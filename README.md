 # PetProtect
 *The really simple plugin to stop the jerks who attempt to kill your pets.*
 
 PetProtect is a really simple plugin to help prevent the death of user pets at the hands of evil rule breakers and jerks. Anyone who doesn't have permissions or isn't the Owner cannot hurt your pet. Horses and such cannot mount other users, preventing them from stealing your transportation.
 
 ## Permissions
 PetProtect uses "petprotect.petkill" in order to control who can kill all pets. Operators bypass this.
